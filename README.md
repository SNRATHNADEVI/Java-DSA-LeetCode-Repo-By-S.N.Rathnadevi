## 🚀 Overview

This is not just another DSA repo. It’s a **battle-tested vault of Java solutions** crafted with care, clarity, and clean code 🧼.  
Each problem here is handpicked and solved from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/SNR66VM/), wrapped in good coding practices — with future devs and recruiters in mind.

📌 Designed to help:
- Java beginners build serious muscle 💪
- Devs prep for placements, hackathons & tech interviews
- Students document & reflect on learning — the smart way
