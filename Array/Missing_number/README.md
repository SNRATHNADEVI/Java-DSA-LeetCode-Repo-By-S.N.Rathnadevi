## 1. 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **linear runtime complexity** and uses **constant extra space**.

---

### ❓ Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0, 3]. 2 is missing.  


### ❓ Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 1]  
Output: 2  


### ❓ Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]  
Output: 8  


---

### 📏 Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All numbers of `nums` are **unique**

---

### 🧠2. Concept / Logic Behind the Problem

> “When you're looking for something that's missing, count what you have — and compare it with what you *should* have.”

#### 💡 Core Insight:
We are given an array `nums` containing `n` **distinct numbers** in the range `[0, n]`. That means **one number is missing** from this complete range.

If we know:
- The **expected sum** of numbers from `0` to `n` (which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`), and
- The **actual sum** of the numbers present in the array,

Then:
- The **missing number** is simply:
- Missing Number = Expected Sum - Actual Sum

#### 🔢 Formula / Math Logic:
- Sum of first `n` natural numbers = `n * (n + 1) / 2`

#### ⚙️ Bitwise Trick (XOR Approach):
- XOR of all numbers from `0` to `n`
- XOR of all elements in the array
- XORing the above two results will give the missing number because duplicate numbers cancel out.

#### 🌍 Real World Metaphor:
Imagine you have a pack of cards numbered from 0 to n, but one card is lost. By knowing the total sum of cards you should have, and subtracting what you currently hold, you identify the missing card.

### 3. Approaches to Solve

- **Brute Force:** Check every number from 0 to n and see if it exists in the array (using nested loops or a search).
- **Sum Formula:** Use the formula for the sum of first n natural numbers and subtract the sum of array elements.
- **XOR Approach:** Use XOR bitwise operation to cancel out existing numbers and find the missing one.
- **Sorting Approach:** Sort the array and check which number is missing by comparing indices.

---

### 4. Brute Force Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  

**Space Complexity:** O(1)  

**Pros:** Simple to understand and implement  

**Cons:** Inefficient for large arrays, slow due to nested loops  

---

### 5. Optimized Approach - Sum Formula Method

 **Explanation:**  
The sum of numbers from 0 to n is given by `n * (n + 1) / 2`.  
By calculating the sum of all numbers present in the array and subtracting it from the expected sum, the difference is the missing number.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — single pass to sum elements

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a few variables used

**Where else can this logic be used:**  
- Finding a missing number in a sequence  
- Detecting single missing values in datasets  
- Simple checksum verification problems

---

### 6. XOR Approach

**Explanation:**  
XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR with 0 is the number itself.  
By XOR-ing all indices (0 to n) and all numbers in the array, pairs cancel out, leaving the missing number.  
This is a classic bitwise trick, making it super efficient.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — single pass

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — constant extra space

**Use cases:**  
- Finding missing numbers in arrays  
- Detecting single errors or anomalies in data  
- Bitwise manipulation problems

---

### 7. Stream Approach (Java 8+)

**Explanation:**  
Uses Java Streams for concise summation of array elements instead of a manual loop.  
The logic remains the same as the sum formula method — find the expected sum and subtract the actual.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Pros:** Cleaner, modern Java syntax

**Cons:** Slight overhead due to streams compared to simple loops

---

### 8. Sorting Approach

**Explanation:**  
Sort the array to have all numbers in order.  
Check each consecutive pair to find where the sequence breaks — the missing number is that gap.  
If no gap found, the missing number is n (the largest number in the range).

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting

**Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n) depending on sorting implementation

**Use cases:**  
- When array is unsorted and quick check is needed  
- Problems where sorted order helps reveal missing elements or duplicates

## 9. Dry Run / How it Works (Step-by-Step Example)

**Example Input:**  
`nums = [3, 0, 1]`

**Step-by-step using Sum Approach:**

1. Length of array = 3 → So, n = 3  
2. Expected Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2 = 3 * 4 / 2 = 6  
3. Actual Sum = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4  
4. Missing Number = Expected Sum - Actual Sum = 6 - 4 = 2 ✅

**Step-by-step using XOR Approach:**

1. XOR all numbers from 0 to n:  
   `0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0 ^ 1 = 1, 1 ^ 2 = 3, 3 ^ 3 = 0`

2. XOR all numbers in the array:  
   `3 ^ 0 ^ 1 = 3 ^ 0 = 3, 3 ^ 1 = 2`

3. Final Missing Number = (XOR of 0 to n) ^ (XOR of nums) = `0 ^ 2 = 2` ✅

## 10. Real World Analogy 🧠

Imagine you're throwing a birthday party and have invited guests numbered 0 to n.  
You hand out party hats with numbers, but after the party, you count and realize **one hat is missing**.

Instead of checking each guest, you could:
- Count how many hats you *should* have (n * (n + 1) / 2).
- Count how many you actually collected.
- The difference is the one that ghosted the party 🎩👻

**Boom! That’s your missing number.**

Bitwise XOR approach is like having invisible ink that reveals the odd one out when everything else cancels out.
